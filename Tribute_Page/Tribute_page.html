        <li>Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a revolutionary inventor, engineer, and futurist.</li>
        <li>Born in modern-day Croatia, he moved to the U.S. and worked briefly with Thomas Edison before parting ways due to differing views on electrical systems.</li>
        <li>Tesla championed alternating current (AC) over Edison's direct current (DC), leading to the famous "War of Currents," which he ultimately won with the help of George Westinghouse.</li>
        <li>Beyond AC power, Tesla invented the Tesla coil, helped advance wireless communication, and even conceptualized wireless energy transmission.</li>
        <li>He dreamed of providing free electricity worldwide and designed the Wardenclyffe Tower, a massive wireless power station, but lost funding.</li>
        <li>Later in life, he became more eccentric, focusing on projects like death rays and thought photography.</li>
        <li>Though he died poor and overlooked, his contributions shaped modern technology, and today, he’s recognized as one of history’s greatest inventors.</li>
      </ul>
